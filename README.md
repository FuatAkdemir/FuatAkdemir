I'm from Turkey and I'm a mechatronics and software engineer. Although I graduated from mechatronics engineering, I turned to software especially in the last years of university. Very few of the projects I have developed are in my Github profile. Unfortunately, I didn't pay much attention to this because I worked more in freelance jobs. However, now I plan to keep this place updated and throw all my projects as much as I can.

I learned embedded systems and IoT first, then front-end web design (Html, Css, Js, Bootstrap), then Android application development (native), then back-end (Php), and finally Python and developed projects with each of them. I continue to learn in Python and NodeJs. I'm going to start with Django. Then I want to learn Dart and Flutter. Although Django and Flutter are my career goals, I am interested in blockchain technologies and the metaverse. I think my versatility shows itself here as well. I love learning and experiencing new things. I guess that makes me me.

My personal website has a few blog posts and details of a few projects I've done. You can also see my blog posts, portfolio and the services I provide on my agency page where I collect my freelance works.

Do not hesitate to contact me for any collaboration or freelance work.

Best regards
